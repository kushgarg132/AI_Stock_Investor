"""The working default FundamentalsProvider (Task 7) -- backed entirely by
the yfinance-derived `CompanyInfo` model that already exists (Task 1's
`fetch_stock_info_logic`), not a re-fetch of raw yfinance `.info`. No paid
fundamentals API key exists in this session (same constraint Task 5 hit for
Kite), so this is the real, working implementation; a second provider
against a paid schema (e.g. BharatStock) can be added later without touching
callers, since they only depend on the `FundamentalsProvider` protocol.
